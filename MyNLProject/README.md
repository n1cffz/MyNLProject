# E-commerce Web Scraper #

This project focuses on web scraping and analysing product data from the Essential Jewellery website. The primary goal is to understand the relationship between product descriptions and their prices, gaining insights into online jewellery retail trends.
Code for scraping, data processing and analysis  can be found in Main_NLProject.ipynb aong with marksowns explaining each step and relevant citations.
For the web scraper code alone, run 'MyNLProject_scraper_code.py'. 
Run through each code starting from the import block.

Additionally, a csv file named 'cleaned_data.csv' can be found in this assignment folder. This contains processed Sale price and Product name which can be used for non-commercia data manipulation.
